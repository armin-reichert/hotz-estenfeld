\section{Right-linear languages, \texorpdfstring{$\rlinlang(X^*)$}{r-LIN(X*)}}

In this section, we investigate an additional method for defining special
subsets of $X^*$. We use the mechanism introduced in chapter I.6, the Chomsky
grammars.

We consider a very simple, restricted type of productions and obtain the {\bf
right-linear} grammars.

\begin{definition}
A Chomsky grammar $G = (N, X, P, S)$ is called
\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{\bf right-linear} & & \text{if } P \subset N \times (X \cdot N \cup X) \\
\text{\bf left-linear}  & & \text{if } P \subset N \times (N \cdot X \cup X)
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{definition}

$X$ is the {\bf terminal alphabet}.

As in chapter I.6 we have the notions of {\em derivation} and {\em generated
language}.

\bigskip
\begin{definition}
\[ \rlinlang(X^*) = \setof{L \subset X^* \mid \text{there exists a right-linear
grammar $G$ with } L = L(G)} \]
is the class of {\bf right-linear languages} in $X^*$.
\end{definition}

In the same way one defines the class of {\bf left-linear languages}.

The following theorem holds:

\begin{theorem}
\[ \reglang(X^*) = \rlinlang(X^*) \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

''$\supset$'': Let $L \in \rlinlang(X^*)$ with $L = L(G),\ G = (N, X, P, S)$.

We construct a graph $\Gamma = (V, E)$ with vertex set $V = N \cup \setof{F},\ F
\notin N$, and edge set $E = P$, i.e.\ the productions of the grammar become
the edges of our graph:
\begin{eqnarray*}
p: v \to x v' \in P & \Rightarrow & e:  v \edge{x} v' \in E \\
p: v \to x \in P & \Rightarrow & e : v \edge{x} F \in E
\end{eqnarray*} 

This defines a finite acceptor $\fa{A} = (\Gamma, X, \setof{S}, \setof{F},
\alpha)$.

It is easily seen that
\[ \pi \in \pathcat{\Gamma} \Rightarrow Q(\pi) \derives{G} \alpha(\pi) \cdot
Z(\pi) \text{, if } Z(\pi) \in N \]

For paths $\pi \in \pathcat{\Gamma}(S, F)$ we get $\alpha(\pi) \in L$. From this
follows $L_{\fa{A}} \subset L(G)$.

Let $w \in L(G)$ be a word generated by the grammar $G$, then there exists a
sequence of derivation steps 
\[ S \dderives{G} x_1 v_1 \dderives{G} x_1 x_2 v_2 \dderives{G} \ldots
\dderives{G} x_1 \cdots x_{n-1} v_{n-1} \dderives{G} w \]

Then the path 
\[ \pi = \big(S, (S,x_1 v_1), (v_1, x_2 v_2), \ldots, (v_{n-1}, x_{n-1}
v_{n-1}), (v_{n-1}, x_n), F\big) \in \pathcat{\Gamma}(S, F) \]
is labelled by
\[ \alpha(\pi) = x_1 \cdots x_n = w \]
which means that the word $w$ is accepted by the finite acceptor, so $w \in
L_{\fa{A}}$.

Together, we get $\lang{A} = L(G)$.

''$\subset$'':

Let $L \in \reglang(X^*),\ L = L_{\fa{A}}$ with a finite acceptor
\[ \fa{A} = (\Gamma, X, S_{\fa{A}}, F_{\fa{A}}, \alpha),\Gamma = (V, E) \] 
and labels $|\alpha(e)| = 1$ for each edge $e \in E$.

We define a right-linear grammar $G = (N, X, P, S)$ with non-terminals $N = E$,
start symbol $S = S_{\fa{A}}$ and production set
\begin{eqnarray*}
P & = & \setof{q \to \alpha(e) \cdot r \mid \exists \text{ edge } e : q \to r
\in E} \\
& \cup & \setof{q \to \alpha(e) \mid \exists \text{ edge } e : q \to r \in E,\
r \in F_{\fa{A}}}
\end{eqnarray*}

It holds $L(G) = L_{\fa{A}}$ (exercise) which completes the proof of the
theorem.
\end{proof}

Remark: It also holds $\llinlang(X^*) = \reglang(X^*)$. This can be seen using
theorem 2 in chapter II.1 which states that $\reglang(X^*)$ is closed under the
mirror-operation.

Given a right-linear grammar $G$ for $L$, one can directly define a left-linear
grammar for the mirror language $L^R$: Replace each production $X \to t \cdot Y$
by a left-linear production $X \to Y \cdot t$. Because of $({L^R})^R = L$ it
then holds $L \in l{-}LIN(X^*)$.

We can therefore in all of the following results replace $\rlinlang(X^*)$ by
$\llinlang(X^*)$.

\bigskip
We extend now our main theorems from section 1. Let $X_\infty$ again be a
countably infinite alphabet and let $\ratlang(X_\infty^*)$ and 
$\reclang(X_\infty^*)$ be defined as before.

\begin{maintheorem}\leavevmode
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $ \reglang(X_\infty^*) = \ratlang(X_\infty^*) = \reclang(X_\infty^*) =
  \rlinlang(X_\infty^*) = \llinlang(X_\infty^*)$
  \item $ \reglang(X_\infty^*)$ is closed under union, intersection,
  complement, Kleene-star, complex product, monoid homomorphisms and inverse
  homomorphisms.
\end{enumerate}
\end{maintheorem}

Each of these language classes motivates a different generalization. We want to
shortly present them:

{\bf Regular languages:} Generalizations into two directions come to mind:
Replace the free monoid $X^*$ by an arbitrary monoid or by special monoids like
free groups or free commutative monoids. We already pointed that out and we will
investigate two important cases later in this book.

The second generalization concerns the free (path) category. By adding a second
operation we get simply computable, infinite categories. The paths in graphs are
then replaced by trees or nets representing the morphisms of these new free
category.

{\bf Rational languages:} Instead of the free monoid one can use arbitrary
monoids. We already made some statements about this. We already know that this
generalization coincides with the corresponding generalization of the regular
sets.

In an even stronger generalization the monoid can be replaced by other algebras,
that is one adds other operations in addition to the monoid operation. The
question arises if in this case the strong relationship between the rational
and the regular sets is preserved.

{\bf Recognizable languages:} Here also two different directions for
generalization come to mind. First, one can keep monoids but replace finite
monoids by simply computable, infinite monoids.

A second generalization concerns the replacement of monoids by other algebras.
Especially the free monoid can be replaced by free algebras and the finite
monoid by finite algebras.

{\bf Right-linear languages:} Here one generalizes by using general Chomsky
grammars (see definition 1, chapter I.6). This last generalization will be in
our focus later.

Our main theorem motivates yet another generalization:

{\bf Abstract Families of Languages (AFL):} The AFL-theory generalizes the
notion of the family of rational languages. This is done by generalizing the
notion of {\bf Kleene-algebra} which is based on the operations of union,
complex product and Kleene-star.

A set $\mathcal{A} \in \powset{X_\infty^*}$ is called {\bf full AFL}, if
$\mathcal{A}$ is closed under the operations of union, complex product,
Kleene-star, homomorphism, inverse homomorphism and intersection with
regular languages.

The idea is the following:

All these operations are ''simple'', therefore using these operations only
''simple sets'' mya be constructed from some given set of ''simple sets''.	It
should be possible to decide the common computer science questions for all	
elements in an AFL if one can decide them for the generating basic sets.

In this book we cannot treat all these topics. Especially, we will not
develop the AFL-theory.

The interested reader is referred to the book by Jean Berstel \cite{Berstel79}
which offers a large space to this theory.
